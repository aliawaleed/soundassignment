# Murder Mystery

## Description

For our project, we decided to walk the user through a murder mystery story that follows along an investigator interrogating 3 suspects for the murder of a woman that is closely related to them. We wanted to create an experience where the users are introduced to the murder and suspects through an investigation as opposed to explicitly telling them. Therefore, the users would be listening to the investigation as a means to piece together the different components of the characters surrounding the murder.

We wanted to create an immersive storytelling experience through sound and the website. Therefore, we made the story interactive by giving the user the opportunity to pick what character they want to skip to their part but also making it participatory by allowing them to choose the murderer. We also divided the story section into three main parts in order to ensure maximum interactivity and engagement with our story. Through the interactivity of the website and the engaging story, we hope to create an immersive online experience.

## Process

Storyline Concept Process:
After we decided on the main idea and had a general idea of how the story would go on, we simultaneously thought about how the story and the website would interact and relate to one another and we wrote a script with scenes that included multiple different storytelling aspects.

We chose and decided on the characters:

1. Investigator Enigma → Aayush
1. Daughter (Ashley) → Alia
1. Babysitter → Liyan
1. Husband (Mr. Grey) → Zharmakhan
1. Dead Person (Ms. Karen) → Stepmom

Then we wrote down the lines for each character and decided on how the story (and scenes) are going to flow in reference to the website and recorded our parts.

## Sound Editing Process

We recorded the different parts of the story by recording the scenes as smaller audio segments and combining and editing them on audacity. We decided to do that as it would be easier to work with and edit/add sound effects to when they’re smaller segments.

We wanted to focus on multiple different parts of sound editing to make our story engaging and grounded:

1. Combining audio clips: Since we recorded many different, shorter audio clips, when combining them, we wanted to make sure that the transitions are smooth and that the volume is consistent across the clips.

1. Sound effects: In order to further ground the story, we added sound effects in 2 different ways. The first way is adding audio independently. An example of this is in the very first scene, adding the phone ringing audio alludes to the scene taking place over the phone. The second way is adding background sound effects. This is seen in the background suspense music when the narrator is first introducing the case and the different background audio added when the suspects are explaining their whereabouts which adds depth to the story.

1. Voice editing: We also edited the voice of the narrator to fit the entire theme and overall concept of our story and website.

## Website Implementation Process

While we were discussing the storyline and recording, we started working on the graphics to picture the setting and what we want our characters to look like and finding characters that we are all satisfied with and follow the same theme.

When we finished all of the recordings and had everything planned out, we started working on the website and dividing it into the sections that are necessary. First off, we got the coordinates of all the characters and mapped their bodies to a respective image of them colored and everything else in the image in black and white, when they are clicked. This allows for user interactivity where it is clear for the user which character is speaking at a given time and which voice corresponds to which character.

We then started adding the audio files and divided the sections of the website in a way where you cannot go to the next step until you finish the one before so that the story is not lost in the way.

## Reflection / Evaluation

When we started, we had trouble getting our idea together and visualizing it in a way that would be smooth and create a storyline that would be believable or logical. However, as we continued, it was coming together and our overall expectations and goals were met.
